Dear Program Committee,

Please consider our submission "AI‑Powered Train Travel Recommendation and Delay Prediction System" for review at your conference. The paper presents an end-to-end pipeline that includes data curation and imputation, a RandomForest-based delay predictor, calibrated conformal prediction intervals for uncertainty quantification, and an explainable recommendation engine delivered through a Flask API and React frontend. The work emphasizes reproducibility and operational deployment and includes artifacts to reproduce the demo results.

We confirm that this manuscript is original, not under review elsewhere, and that all authors consent to this submission. For questions or to request additional proofs or data, please contact the corresponding author at niharika.s@example.edu.

Sincerely,
The TrainDelay AI Team
