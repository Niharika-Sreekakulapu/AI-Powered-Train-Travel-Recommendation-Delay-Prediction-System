\section{Methods}
\subsection{Modeling}
We use a RandomForestRegressor trained on engineered features (route, distance, day, month, season, weather). Hyperparameters used in the demo training (see `train_model.py`) include `n_estimators=100` and `max_depth=10`. Model artifacts and encoders are saved for inference in `backend/`.

\subsection{Uncertainty and Explainability}
To quantify uncertainty, we compute split‑conformal 95\% prediction intervals from held‑out calibration sets (`scripts/conformal_intervals.py`). For per‑prediction explanations, the backend exposes top feature contributors and simple SHAP‑style attributions to inform recommendations.

\subsection{Recommendation and Risk Scoring}
Recommendations rank candidate trains by lightweight aggregated scores combining predicted delay, price, and a reliability component derived from prediction interval width and imputation flags. A simple deterministic risk score (0–100) is computed and returned alongside each recommendation.
