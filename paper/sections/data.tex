\section{Data and Preprocessing}
The project uses a curated route‑level dataset stored in \texttt{data/} (notably \texttt{ap_trains_master_clean.csv} and \texttt{train_data\_*.csv}). The demo dataset contains roughly 250+ route records with features including train id, source, destination, distance, day of week, month, season, weather condition, price, and historical average delay. Key preprocessing steps:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Construct \texttt{route} as \texttt{source-destination} and scale numeric features such as distance.
  \item Encode categorical features (route, weather, season) using label encoders saved with model artifacts.
  \item Apply imputation pipelines for missing RailRadar features and flag imputed values (flags v4–v7 pipeline in \texttt{scripts/}).
  \item Produce conformal calibration splits to compute 95\% prediction intervals.
\end{itemize}
For reproducibility, versioned artifacts and scripts are included (e.g., \texttt{models/rr_mean_model_tuned.joblib}, \texttt{backend/model.pkl}).
