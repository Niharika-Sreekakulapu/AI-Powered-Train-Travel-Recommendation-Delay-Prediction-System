\section{Discussion}
The results indicate that a carefully curated dataset and an ensemble model yield accurate route‑level delay estimates in the demo setting. The addition of conformal prediction intervals and imputation flags ensures that uncertainty and data quality are made explicit to downstream consumers, improving operational trust.

Future work includes scaling to larger datasets, temporal sequence modeling to capture propagation effects, rigorous ablation studies, and user studies assessing whether risk‑aware recommendations improve traveler decisions.
