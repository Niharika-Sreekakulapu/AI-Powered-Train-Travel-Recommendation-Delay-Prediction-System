\section{Conclusion}
We present TrainDelay AI, an end‑to‑end train delay prediction and travel recommendation system that couples a RandomForest predictor with conformal uncertainty quantification and a risk‑scored recommendation engine. The repository provides scripts and artifacts to reproduce the demo results and to extend the system; future work should evaluate the system at scale and integrate streaming inputs for real‑time operations.
