\section{Introduction}
Accurate short‑term train delay prediction helps passengers and operators make informed decisions and reduces travel risk. Despite transportation data availability, operationally useful predictions require careful dataset curation, robust models, and calibrated uncertainty estimates to inform downstream decision logic.

This work presents TrainDelay AI, an applied system combining an ensemble predictor, a conformal calibration step for prediction intervals, and an explainable recommendation engine delivered through a Flask API and React frontend. Our contributions are:
\begin{itemize}
  \item A complete, reproducible pipeline for train delay prediction from raw data to a deployed API, including artifacts and scripts to reproduce key results.
  \item Integration of calibrated conformal intervals and imputation flagging to manage uncertainty arising from missing or imputed features, with diagnostics to guide operational thresholds.
  \item Explainable recommendations and a risk score that ranks candidate trains by delay risk, cost, and reliability; we include a short case study in the Appendix demonstrating typical failure modes and recommended thresholds.
\end{itemize}
