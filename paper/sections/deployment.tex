\section{Deployment and Reproducibility}
The system is deployed as a Flask API (\texttt{backend/app.py}) serving endpoints for prediction, explanation, recommendation, and propagation analyses. The React frontend consumes these endpoints and presents predictions with risk advice.

Reproducibility artifacts included in the repository:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \texttt{train_model.py}, \texttt{scripts/} (imputation, calibration, and testing), and \texttt{requirements.txt} for environment setup.
  \item Saved model artifacts and encoders in \texttt{backend/} and \texttt{models/}.
  \item Tests that validate the imputation pipeline and price estimator. Use \texttt{pytest} to run the test suite.
\end{itemize}

To ease replication for reviewers, a Dockerfile and \texttt{run_experiments.sh} are recommended additions (I can add them on request).
