\section{Deployment and Reproducibility}
The system is deployed as a Flask API (`backend/app.py`) serving endpoints for prediction, explanation, recommendation, and propagation analyses. The React frontend consumes these endpoints and presents predictions with risk advice.

Reproducibility artifacts included in the repository:
\begin{itemize}
  \item `train_model.py`, `scripts/` (imputation, calibration, and testing), and `requirements.txt` for environment setup.
  \item Saved model artifacts and encoders in `backend/` and `models/`.
  \item Tests that validate the imputation pipeline and price estimator. Use `pytest` to run the test suite.
\end{itemize}

To ease replication for reviewers, a Dockerfile and `run_experiments.sh` are recommended additions (I can add them on request).
