Submission checklist (recommended)

1. Author details
   - Confirm author names and order.
   - Fill affiliations, city/country, and email or ORCID in `paper/main.tex`.

2. Remove template text
   - Ensure no template instruction text remains in the final PDF (e.g., example text from conference Word templates).

3. Figures and tables
   - Ensure all figures are high resolution (300 dpi) and follow figure caption rules.
   - Check table formatting and captions.

4. References and plagiarism
   - Add all citations; compile `references.bib` and run BibTeX.
   - Run a plagiarism check (Turnitin, iThenticate) and ensure proper paraphrasing and citations.

5. Reproducibility artifacts
   - Include `requirements.txt`, `paper/README.md`, and `paper/Dockerfile` in the repo.
   - Optionally upload code snapshot and data to Zenodo/figshare and add DOI in the paper.

6. Final PDF checks
   - Compile IEEE PDF (use Dockerfile or GitHub Actions workflow). Verify margins, columns, and font embedding.
   - Check that author emails/ORCID are correct and that the corresponding author is identified.

7. Submission materials
   - Prepare cover letter, title/keywords, and suggested reviewers list (if required by conference).

8. Post-submit
   - Prepare an arXiv preprint if desired. Update GitHub with a release and a reproducibility README linking to artifacts.

Notes:
- If you want, I can prepare the cover letter and reviewer suggestions for ITSC and help run a plagiarism check on the draft text.
